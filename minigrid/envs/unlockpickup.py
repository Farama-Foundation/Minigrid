class UnlockPickupEnv(RoomGrid):
    """
    ## Description

    The agent has to pick up a box which is placed in another room, behind a
    locked door. This environment can be solved without relying on language.

    ## Mission Space

    "pick up the {color} box"

    {color} is the color of the box. Can be "red", "green", "blue", "purple",
    "yellow" or "grey".

    ## Action Space

    | Num | Name         | Action                    |
    |-----|--------------|---------------------------|
    | 0   | left         | Turn left                 |
    | 1   | right        | Turn right                |
    | 2   | forward      | Move forward              |
    | 3   | pickup       | Pick up an object         |
    | 4   | drop         | Unused                    |
    | 5   | toggle       | Toggle/activate an object |
    | 6   | done         | Unused                    |

    ## Observation Encoding

    - Each tile is encoded as a 3 dimensional tuple:
        `(OBJECT_IDX, COLOR_IDX, STATE)`
    - `OBJECT_TO_IDX` and `COLOR_TO_IDX` mapping can be found in
        [minigrid/core/constants.py](minigrid/core/constants.py)
    - `STATE` refers to the door state with 0=open, 1=closed and 2=locked

    ## Rewards

    A reward of '1 - 0.9 * (step_count / max_steps)' is given for success, and '0' for failure.

    ## Termination

    The episode ends if any one of the following conditions is met:

    1. The agent picks up the correct box.
    2. Timeout (see `max_steps`).
