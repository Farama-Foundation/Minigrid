    ### Description

    Depending on the `obstacle_type` parameter:
    - `Lava` - The agent has to reach the green goal square on the other corner
        of the room while avoiding rivers of deadly lava which terminate the
        episode in failure. Each lava stream runs across the room either
        horizontally or vertically, and has a single crossing point which can be
        safely used; Luckily, a path to the goal is guaranteed to exist. This
        environment is useful for studying safety and safe exploration.
    - otherwise - Similar to the `LavaCrossing` environment, the agent has to
        reach the green goal square on the other corner of the room, however
        lava is replaced by walls. This MDP is therefore much easier and maybe
        useful for quickly testing your algorithms.

    ### Mission Space
    Depending on the `obstacle_type` parameter:
    - `Lava` - "avoid the lava and get to the green goal square"
    - otherwise - "find the opening and get to the green goal square"

    ### Action Space

    | Num | Name         | Action       |
    |-----|--------------|--------------|
    | 0   | left         | Turn left    |
    | 1   | right        | Turn right   |
    | 2   | forward      | Move forward |
    | 3   | pickup       | Unused       |
    | 4   | drop         | Unused       |
    | 5   | toggle       | Unused       |
    | 6   | done         | Unused       |

    ### Observation Encoding

    - Each tile is encoded as a 3 dimensional tuple:
        `(OBJECT_IDX, COLOR_IDX, STATE)`
    - `OBJECT_TO_IDX` and `COLOR_TO_IDX` mapping can be found in
        [minigrid/minigrid.py](minigrid/minigrid.py)
    - `STATE` refers to the door state with 0=open, 1=closed and 2=locked

    ### Rewards

    A reward of '1' is given for success, and '0' for failure.

    ### Termination

    The episode ends if any one of the following conditions is met:

    1. The agent reaches the goal.
    2. The agent falls into lava.
    3. Timeout (see `max_steps`).

    ### Registered Configurations

    S: size of the map SxS.
    N: number of valid crossings across lava or walls from the starting position
    to the goal

    - `Lava` :
        - `MiniGrid-LavaCrossingS9N1-v0`

        - `MiniGrid-LavaCrossingS9N3-v0`
        - `MiniGrid-LavaCrossingS11N5-v0`

    - otherwise :
        - `MiniGrid-SimpleCrossingS9N1-v0`
        - `MiniGrid-SimpleCrossingS9N2-v0`
        - `MiniGrid-SimpleCrossingS9N3-v0`
