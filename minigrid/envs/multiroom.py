    ### Description

    This environment has a series of connected rooms with doors that must be
    opened in order to get to the next room. The final room has the green goal
    square the agent must get to. This environment is extremely difficult to
    solve using RL alone. However, by gradually increasing the number of rooms
    and building a curriculum, the environment can be solved.

    ### Mission Space

    "traverse the rooms to get to the goal"

    ### Action Space

    | Num | Name         | Action                    |
    |-----|--------------|---------------------------|
    | 0   | left         | Turn left                 |
    | 1   | right        | Turn right                |
    | 2   | forward      | Move forward              |
    | 3   | pickup       | Unused                    |
    | 4   | drop         | Unused                    |
    | 5   | toggle       | Toggle/activate an object |
    | 6   | done         | Unused                    |

    ### Observation Encoding

    - Each tile is encoded as a 3 dimensional tuple:
        `(OBJECT_IDX, COLOR_IDX, STATE)`
    - `OBJECT_TO_IDX` and `COLOR_TO_IDX` mapping can be found in
        [minigrid/minigrid.py](minigrid/minigrid.py)
    - `STATE` refers to the door state with 0=open, 1=closed and 2=locked

    ### Rewards

    A reward of '1' is given for success, and '0' for failure.

    ### Termination

    The episode ends if any one of the following conditions is met:

    1. The agent reaches the goal.
    2. Timeout (see `max_steps`).

    ### Registered Configurations

    S: size of map SxS.
    N: number of rooms.

    - `MiniGrid-MultiRoom-N2-S4-v0` (two small rooms)
    - `MiniGrid-MultiRoom-N4-S5-v0` (four rooms)
    - `MiniGrid-MultiRoom-N6-v0` (six rooms)
