This environment has been built as part of work done at [Mila](https://mila.quebec). The Dynamic obstacles environment has been added as part of work done at [IAS in TU Darmstadt](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) and the University of Genoa for mobile robot navigation with dynamic obstacles.
